# Unicorn vs. Narwhal Classifier
Below, I'll be implementing a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python to classify images of unicorns and narwhals. You can read the full blog post and get more background on the project at https://shaynechammavanijakul.com/2020/07/14/unicorn-narwhal-classifier/.

In this repository, you'll find the following materials: 

# unicorn_narwhal_photos
These contain the four hundred images I used for both testing and training. 

## unicorn_narwhal_model_train
Here, we prepare our images for training using Keras, and then both build and save our binary classification model. 

## unicorn_narwhal_model_test
Here, we test the model we've created. Load an image through the path, and the model will determine whether a unicorn or a narwhal is detected.
